This repository contains all the assignments completed during my participation in the **TATA Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights Project** on Forage Tata.

## TATA Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

**TATA IQ** offers this virtual experience program. In this program, I had the opportunity to work with passionate multidisciplinary experts who use data visualization technologies like Tableau and Power BI to tackle complex business problems and unearth valuable insights from data.

The program simulates the real-world challenges faced by Tata Insights and Quants, giving participants a taste of what it's like to work in data-driven decision-making environments.

### Program Modules

There are four modules in this virtual experience program:

1. **Framing the Business Scenario**
   - Learn to anticipate the questions your business leaders will need answers to.

2. **Choosing the Right Visuals**
   - Discover which visuals are most effective in different scenarios.

3. **Creating Effective Visuals**
   - Apply your skills to create visuals based on business scenarios.

4. **Communicating Insights and Analysis**
   - Effectively communicate your findings and insights to business leaders.

### Task 1 - Framing the Business Scenario

#### Background and Context

In this task, you'll act as a consultant for an online retail store. The CEO and CMO have hired you to analyze their data and provide valuable insights for strategic planning and expansion. You need to draft questions that both the CEO and CMO would ask to guide your analysis. These questions should encompass both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the business.

#### Key Deliverable

Prepare a set of four questions for each business leader (4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO).

### Task 2 - Choosing the Right Visuals

#### Background and Context

As part of this task, you'll provide visuals for the metrics requested by the CEO and CMO. The challenge is to choose the most suitable visual representation for each scenario to avoid conveying incorrect messages or decisions. The senior management aims to understand the business's performance and identify growth opportunities.

#### Key Deliverable

Answer a multiple-choice quiz to select the appropriate visuals for different business scenarios.

### Task 3 - Creating Effective Visuals

#### Background and Context

Now, you will create visuals based on the questions from Task 1. You need to ensure the data is cleaned properly and then create the visuals using either Tableau or Power BI. The CEO and CMO are interested in analyzing trends and key factors affecting the online store's revenue.

#### Key Deliverable

Create visuals for the following questions:
1. Time series of revenue data for the year 2011, broken down by month.
2. Top 10 revenue-generating countries (excluding the United Kingdom), including quantity sold.
3. Visual showing the top 10 customers by revenue, with a gradual decline in revenue.
4. Visual representing demand for products in different regions, excluding the United Kingdom.

### Task 4 - Communicating Insights and Analysis

#### Background and Context

Now it's time to present your findings to the CEO and CMO. You should explain your thought process, data cleanup, and analysis. The leaders are interested in understanding the most lucrative opportunities for expansion.

#### Key Deliverable

Develop a script and record a 5-minute video presentation that communicates your findings and insights based on the four questions from Task 3. Ensure you provide context for each scenario and its relevance to their questions. Make it clear and straightforward.
